# Architecture

The application is written in Golang. It provides a Docker API for managing the Docker containers used to run the listed services (start/stop/restart), as well as a Worker that runs via crontab at a 1 minute interval and scrapes data from each of the services.

# Worker

The worker is made to make requests to various services, grab data from them, format it, and store it in a MySQL database. This allows Grafana to hook into the database and visualize the data generated by the services. A dependency injection pattern is used for this module in order to make this application flexible. By using this pattern new services can easily be added in the future as a new dependency and injected into the existing environment.
