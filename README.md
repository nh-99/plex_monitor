# Worker Architecture

The worker is made to make requests to various services, grab data from them, format it, and store it in a MySQL database. This allows Grafana to hook into the database and visualize the data generated by the services. A dependency injection pattern is used for this module in order to make this application flexible. By using this pattern new services can easily be added in the future as a new dependency and injected into the existing service, executing alongside the other scanners.

# Environment Variables
The `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` environment variables must be set. The database URL is just the typical connection string for a MySQL database in Golang, which looks like `user:pass@tcp(127.0.0.1)/database_name?parseTime=true`. Secret key should be set specifically for your environment.
